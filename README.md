This project is a PHP-based blog site developed using Laravel version 9.52 and LiveWire version 2.
In this project, the blog component was utilized, and I familiarized myself with packages such as Sweet Alert. I learned about methods like modal, fill, and reset, incorporating them into the program.
I have learned an advanced and very new technology and tool in the PHP domain, and I have been able to ensure the real-time behavior of my application.
